# Changelog

All notable changes to LeanType will be documented in this file.

## [v4.0.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **PointerTracker TimerProxy Safety**: Fixed `NullPointerException` on `TimerProxy.startTypingStateTimer` by defensively defaulting static `sTimerProxy` to `TimerProxy.NULL` and guarding accesses when proxy map references are cleared during view teardowns or transitions.
- **Dynamic InputConnection & Long Press Fix**: Fixed issue where re-opening the keyboard in Launcher or search fields dropped character input and long-press popup key selections by dynamically fetching the live system `InputConnection`.

## [v4.0.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **First-Word Prediction Toggle**: User setting to enable/disable suggestions for first word in text field.
- **Hardware Keyboard Mode**: Option to display toolbar-only mode when physical keyboard is connected.
- **Equal Toolbar Key Spacing**: Equal key distribution for unscrollable expanded and dual toolbars.

### Fixed
- **Native JNI Protection**: Added `isValidDictionary()` guards and exception handling around `BinaryDictionary` JNI calls.
- **ANR & Freeze Prevention**: Added non-blocking timeouts to `CountDownLatch.await()` across backup/restore and file lookup paths.
- **Gesture Index Thread Storm**: Switched gesture index building to managed `KEYBOARD` executor pool.
- **Memory & View Leak Fixes**: Cleared static proxy references in `PointerTracker.clearOldViewData()`, enabled `largeHeap`, and trimmed memory when UI hidden.
- **Screenshot Scanner Optimization**: Replaced active background `ContentObserver` with on-demand check.
- **Regional Dictionary Fallback**: Aggregated main/emoji dictionaries across variant and language fallbacks (`en-IN` -> `en`).
- **Emoji Dictionary Persistence**: Fixed recognition of downloaded `emoji_*.dict` files and added preference tracking to prevent deletion on upgrade.
- **Thai Word Segmentation**: Preserved Thai word boundaries during text expansion.

### AI Enhancements
- **Proofread Anti-Answering Guard**: Prevented models from expanding prompts into multi-paragraph answers during proofreading.
- **Clean Translation Output**: Stripped section headers and reasoning/thinking blocks from translation outputs.
